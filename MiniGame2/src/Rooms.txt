Tartarus Cliffs
You stand on the edge of the cliffs, overlooking the deep abyss into Tartarus. You can hear the roars from the titans below.--You just crawled out and are going to begin your ascension back to Olympus. The path to the underworld is north. The Entrance to Asphodel is to the South.

Path to the Underworld
You step forward towards a mountain range with no end in sight. It will be a long, arduous journey but you have waited eons to escape--and enact your vengeance on the new gods. The path forward to Asphodel is to the West. The cliffs of Tartarus are to the East.

Entrance to Asphodel
Considering this isn't the usual way you find into the underworld, there isn't much fanfare surrounding the entrance. Just a gate with a--couple of statues of Hades surrounded by tress on all sides. This is where your path begins. The Path to the Underworld is down. Theres a shortcut back to the Cliffs of Tartarus to Up.
